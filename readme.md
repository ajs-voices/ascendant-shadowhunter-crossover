## A Different New York City

Assassination attempts threaten the life of the newly ascended leader of the Venatori and the Creed of Celestial Beings but that's to be expected when not all your followers are happy with your reign.  The current attempt by an inept human mage sends Nox through a golden portal that opens up into an alternate New York City in the middle of a spawn of demons.  Befriending the local Shadowhunters and warlocks was the easy part, figuring out a way back when their world is riddled with demons attacks proves to be difficult for Nox as there is very little down time to figure out what had happened.  The Book of the White, once consulted provides a way home, but it lies in the heart of the secret country of the Shadowhunters homeland and since the Dark War outsiders are not welcome in the Capital, the one place that Nox must go to get home.  Diplomacy doesn't work, and Nox with the help of his new friends sneak into the capital and steal the necessary transportation home but not without a few bumps along the way.
