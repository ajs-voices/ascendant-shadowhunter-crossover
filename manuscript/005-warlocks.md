# Warlocks

I leaned against the sink and washed the used bottles and placed them in the drying rack. I felt eyes watching me and I turned around to see magic and flamboyance standing in the kitchen doorway watching me.  "Bored?  You can clean the rest of the house.  We won't mind."

I grinned at him.  "I likely will when I can't sleep."

"You assumed you were staying?"

"I assumed I'd be here till your curiousity was satisfied.  Glowing orbs, not being a warlock, all that stuff."  I waved my hands and he caught my hand turning it over to admire the colors.  

"Not very well done, your manicurist needs a few lessons."  He dropped my hand and waved his own in front of me, "Mine is excellent I can't recomend her enough."


I grinned, "Mine is 8.  She does perfectly fine.  And I don't think your boyfriend wants you checking out my fingers or me flirting with you."

He turned and looked over his shoulder at Alec who was sitting in the window staring out at the street below with a scowl on his face.  Maguns smiled.  "He's pouting because he didn't get to feed Max or put him down."

"I'm sorry.  I figured he'd be more help then I clearly was.  I can go wake him up."

Alec jumped from the window seat and shook his head, "You will not!"

I smiled playfully.  "As if I'd waking a sleeping baby.  I know the silence is precious.  There is so little of it in my house, and we've only got one crying baby - the rest are crying adults who must have my attention at 3 in the morning when the moon is full and I'm fighting ever fucking werewolf's change from overpowering my senses."

"Now I'm really confused."  Magnus said.  "You aren't a warlock, yet you weild fire like it's nothing.  And you do something with werewolf changes?"

"The old ones call me Ascendant - a rising power.  I'm a Magnus, "I grinned at the name.  "pecifically a Cesari - I bend all four elements at the same time.  On top of that my mother was human, but carried the werewolf virus but never changed.  My father is Venatori - a supernatural race designed specifically to hunt monsters.  And somewhere along the path, a vampire bit me and instead of killing me like vampire venom does to most Venatori it mutated my genes into some freek of nature so when I died, I didn't really die - immortality."

Mangus' eyes grew wide at the last little bit.  "That seems very fairy tale like to me."

"I'm living proof that fairy-tales are real."  I waved my hand and a shower of sparks floated down.

Alec grunted, "Show off."  He sat down on the couch, "You two are a pair."

I laughed and stepped around Magnus.  "And you love it.  Don't try to fight it."

He looked up at me and frowned, but I saw the smile fighting back.  "You like watching your boyfriend show off.  Knowing he's yours."  I laughed.  "You and Dorian would be two peas in a pod."

"Dorian?"  Alec asked curiously.

"I told you my love life was complicated.  He's my boyfriend and that's all I'll say about that."

Magnus sat down next to Alec and I sat on the floor. I looked around for the rest of the crew but they seemed to have vanished in the night.  Magnus waved a hand, "I sent them home via portal."

"Purple swirling hole in the world, gotcha.  A human mage at home in a stupid meeting chanted some words and a golden one of those set me down right in the middle of those... shadowy demon things.  Demons in my world can't mainfest like that they can only take human hosts - though half demons we do have but they aren't warlocks, no magic really to speak of."

"Golden..."  Magnus' painted fingernails played against Alec's leg while the other he tapped against his chin.  "Never made one of them before, do you remember what he was chanting?"

I shook my head.  "No, languages aren't my thing.  But it's human magic not natural like mine.  I can't do anything that isn't made up of the elements, so I'm stuck wherever here is until we can find someone to send me home."  I sighed.  This was going to suck, I already missed my family.  I laid back on the hardwood floor of their living room and stared up at the ceiling.  "I don't want to intrude on your family.  Tell me where the nearest hotel is and I'll go there."

"I think not."  Magnus stood up and waved down the direction of Max's room.  "There is a spare bed across from Max, use it until we send you home.  Alec will take you to the Institue in the morning and maybe they will know more while I go to the Spiral Labrythn and see what I can find there."
