# The Clave

I had eaten everything else that I'd made.  Jace had come back for seconds disappointed.   Our night progressed slowly with nothing really to do.   Jace and Clary were snuggled up on one of the frilly couches that adorned Magnus' apartment.   Simon and Izzy were luring on the floor entwined in each other's arms.   Alec and Magnus occupied the other couch.   And the three couples watched some reality TV slow.   Neither Ant nor I were overly interested so I read in the library just inside the master suite.   Ant stood outside the door standing guard like he'd done so many times at home. 

As the four shadowhunters who doesn't live there left in pairs.   Magnus and Alec me in their library.   Alec sat down in his chair with the book I tossed at him and started reading where he'd left off.   Magnus smiled at me. "We could have been doing this before.   They didn't have to stay." 

I nodded. "They ate your family.   I'm fine on my own."

"And him?"

"Ant is doing what he does at home."

Magnus grabbed Ant's arm and made him sit down in another chair.   "Sit.  Relax. Enjoy." Magnus conjured a cocktail and handed it to Ant, who took it gratefully.   He didn't offer Alec or myself one.   I'd probably refused him one too many times.   Alec loomed to engrossed in his book to care one way or another. 

We lounged for another hour before I took my leave and went for a run.   Which meant Ant went with me.  Afterwards we shared a bed, in the most platonic way.   I had missed the warmth of another body in my bed. 

I woke to squawking across the hall and got up to check on Max and found Alec already there.  He smiled as he walked past the open bedroom door Ant still slept in. I followed him into the kitchen for a drink.   Alec prepared a bottle. "There are other rooms."

I took a sip of water from a glass Alec poured as he made the bottle.  "We know.  He won't leave my side.   And it feels good to have someone in my bed."

Alec blushed so I added, "I don't think I've had an empty bed since I joined the CCB." I absently rubbed the tattoo at my right temple. 

"I was wondering about the tattoo."  Alec was busily feeding the squirming child in his arms as he continued, "I mean I know it means exiled in Chinese but that's not the story is it?"

I nodded.  "You are right.  It marks me as disgraced.  I was exiled for trying to kill our leader, who ironically I killed later anyway.  He'd created some elaborate plan to ferret out those who were trying to really kill him, and he needed me to do it.  So by our law I could have died for trying to kill him without issuing a challenge first, but he exiled me because I was just a pawn.  His words not mine.  All Venatori have a tattoo of two crossed swords that only supernatural creatures or humans with magical sight can see.  This covers that declaring me exiled and disgraced to the whole world.  It's magical in that it covers the magic of the symbol, but it's normal ink, and the whole world sees it."

"How does that work now that you lead these Venatori?"

"Honestly I don't know.  I'm not Venatori, I'm not Were, or dragon or even vampire, but I've a stake in everyone of those races.  Isabel is my wife, my mate and my second in command of the pack, she is the reason I can rule over my pack without question.  Challenges would come down quickly as they did when I first started leading them.  I can't run with them during the hunt, it hurts my standing.  But with Isabel at my side I can send her instead.  The Venatori are harder to explain how they tolerate me, but they still have their council, still do the same things they did then, except I'm making them change, not letting them go about life killing supernatural creatures because they've robbed a bank.  Fair trials.  I haven't removed killing on sight for the henious crimes, but usually its because it's self defense.  I want the story the full story before we take drastic measures.  I understand some supernatural creatures are beyond repair and they must be ended.  But a wolf who turns unknowningly and kills a man walking by, that's not the same as killing for sport."

Alec was smiling, "I think Magnus, was right, we are a lot alike."

I grinned at him, "It's probably why we get along so well."  I set the now empty glass in the sink, "I'll wash that later, I better get back to Ant before he's sending out a search party for my body."

Alec nodded.  "If I'd known you were... um..."

I smiled at Alec, "I don't want to intrude upon your life.  I'm capable of sleeping alone.  I'm just glad Ant's here now.  Though I wish he'd have stayed to protect my family."  I sighed and headed back to my room and laid down next to Ant who dutifully wrapped his arms around me.  We slept the remainder of the night like that except I was up a few hours later woken by my own nightmares again.

AFter a long shower I found the other three men geared up and ready to go to the Institue.  Max was bundled up and Magnus was weaving a portal.  Alec smiled at me, "You took longer than usual."

I frowned, "Nightmares, long runs and depression don't preceed short showers."  I gestured at the portal, "Are we coming along?"

Magnus turned my direction, "But of course, we can't have your petition be heard if you can't speak for yourself.  You are a leader among leaders of your own kind, maybe Maryse and Robert and the rest of the conclave will hear your plea with that in mind."

I sighed, "The Lightwoods do not like me.  I doubt the rest of this conclave will either."

Alec laughed, "It has more to do with me than with you."

"All the more reason for me to make their life a living hell."  I said flatly.

Ant chuckled, "I take your parents aren't fond of your living arrangements."  Alec nodded then stepped through the portal.  Ant followed and I joined them soon afterwards.  I didn't regret not eating, Ant looke releaved as well as we both caught our breaths from the near drowing of our own stomachs.  Ant looked up at Alec, "If your culture is homophobic, then I don't think presenting Nox is going to make his plea any better."

Alec gave Ant a confused look and Ant continued, "He becomes very.... how does one put it nicely."

I intteruptted, "I have a bad tendancy to play up the gay and make it a well known fact and flaunt myself in that capacity when someone is openly homophobic."
